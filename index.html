      Sound recordings have a unique way of capturing the duration of a ritual, rather than its measured time.

    <!-- <p>Measured time: quarantine, incubation, statistical modeling, tracking, interruption. Our sense of time is suppressed currently by a steady march of crises, first by COVID-19’s sudden intrusion on pre-existing  <span id="dots">...</span>
      <span id="more">social life, or what has come to be known as the “normal” everyone wishes to “get back to.” Time is on hold, and everywhere time is being counted. For instance, the first time-object with which much of the world became familiar was quarantine, the 8th most searched term in 2020, according to Google’s 2020 Year in Search data release. Projections of time: the time between contracting the virus and showing symptoms. This sense of time was projected further onto statistical modeling, say when superspreader events preceded a spike in hospital cases two weeks later, and the number of hospital beds would compress under the exponential rate of infection.

      Here the predictability of past time bringing a sense of order to the chaotic time that lies ahead. And those of us who, at the beginning at least, took to exercise routines and data tracking, became accustomed to turning the body of the wearer into a measured time object: every pulse counted, changes to the intervals between heartbeats recorded, blood flow accounted for, breathing rates monitored at least enough for the Watch to interrupt and remind its wearer that it is time, again, to breathe, or wash your hands for 20 seconds (Happy birthday twice, happy birthday twice). Time for the dog to have another walk. Time to feed the cat, vacuum the floor, waste time streaming. Finally, not as if this would mark the end of a definitive list, but there is far too much time suddenly: isolation, boredom, exhaustion, uncertainty, all have been the effect of this stage wherein which time is on hold – such private inner experiences as exhaustion and boredom are spatialized. So many dimensions to time, what Steffen Mau refers to as the quantification of everything that makes the concrete experience of time, the visceral flow of becoming imperceptible, a near impossibility. Time, the great intruder on time.</p>

            The anxieties and uncertainties of contemporary life allow intruders into our own sense of being present. 
            The past, heavy with all that has come to be, casts the future in its shadow. So how do we make the present become again? 
            Rituals offer some hope. Little rituals. Through our rituals, we experience time in a different way. As duration. 
            Duration does not measure time with a clock. It lasts as long as it takes to complete a ritual. It is an experience felt by the body.

              <br>
              <br> Grid of Nows is a research project that asks participants to submit sound recordings of themselves making tea, a ritual for many as tea is the most consumed beverage in the world after water. </span>

            Sound recordings have a unique way of capturing the duration of a ritual. Below are the sound 
            recordings of participants who were asked to record their tea-making rituals. Their recordings are actors in an ongoing composition 
            about the problem of time in these times of growing uncertainty.
